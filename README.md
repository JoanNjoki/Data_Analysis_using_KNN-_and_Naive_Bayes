## Project Description
>1. *Spam Mail project:*
>There is a surge of mails coming through the mail boxes that arent warranted by the user. Words such as buy now, act now, click here and get it now fill the mail boxes.  Reducing false positives is required as mails that arent spam can be stored in the spam category making the user miss out on vital information. This analysis will use KNN Classifier to correctly classify mail as junk mails or solicited mails.
>2. *Titanic Project:*
>On 15th April 1912, the Royal Mail Ship(RMS) sank after hitting an iceberg during its maiden voyage to Newyork City from the SouthHampton, England. Unfortunately, 1500 out of the 2224 passengers and crew died due to inadequate life boats. This data analysis will use Naive Bayes classifier, a machine learning technique, to predict if the type of individual could have contributed to their survival.
